# Customer Management System

This is a basic Customer Management System developed using the Spring Framework. The project demonstrates the use of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) in a Spring-based Java application.

## Build Tool Choice

I chose **Maven** as the build tool for this project because of its simplicity, standard project structure, and wide adoption in the Java ecosystem.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `mvn clean install` to build the project.
4. Use your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) to open the project.
5. Run the `MainApp` class to start the application.

## Challenges Faced

- Configuring dependencies for Spring Framework.
- Understanding the difference between constructor and setter injection.

## Assumptions Made

- The application uses a mock database (a list of customers) instead of a real database.
- Email notifications are simulated using simple print statements.
